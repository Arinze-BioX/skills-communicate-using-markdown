# Markdown Practice on GitHub
The Header written above is the largest header: an `<H1>` header, while the one directly below this text is an `<H3>` header.

### Now adding images (with no space between this header and the next small header)
###### Here is an image of Yaktocat (I'll have to find out the origin of this fun name!)
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

The image above can be slightly modified by using html to add the image (see the smaller image below). HTML allows some control for how the image is shown, although better control can be done using style sheets written in another file

<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png" alt="Image of Yaktocat" width="150" heigth="150"/>

### Now adding some code
This is just a git initialization code
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

Interestingly, language-specific syntax highlighting can be achieved when the language is specified on the same line as the first ` ``` `. For instance:
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
In the above code, syntax highlighting for the javascript language has been enabled.
